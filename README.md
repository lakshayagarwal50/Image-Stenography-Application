# Image-Stenography-Application
A Python application to hide text within images using steganography


## Description
This is a simple Python application that allows users to hide text within images using steganography. The application provides a simple and easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter. Users can encode text within an image and save the resulting image to their local machine. They can also decode hidden text from an image by selecting the image file. The application uses the `Pillow` library to work with images and the `base64` module to encode and decode text.
